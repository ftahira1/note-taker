# Note-Taker

## Description
This project introduces bootcamp students like me, to Express.js (Express), standard server framework for Node.js. It is used to build a web app with backend functionality with a built-in Fetch API package.

In this project, there is a starter code where the frontend was built and we used Express in order to build the server side along with modular routing to organize our routes. Then this application was then deployed on Heroku.

## Installation
This is a Node.js application. It is recommended to use v18 for this app to run properly.
This was built on Express. When in your project folder, type in 'npm i' to install the dependency listed in the package.json file.

## Usage
